# The Scala.js advanced case study

Cloned from https://github.com/scala-js/scalajs-tutorial

# Intent

Extend the application of Scala.js to use cases which make shared use of business data & logic.

In complex applications the "business logic" spans multiple tiers and Scala.js is a powerful way to support DRY
designs through careful isolation of shared responsibilities.
